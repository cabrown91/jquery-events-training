The training was good, yet challenging. I'm not sure that all the exercises do what I want them to. Ready works, but I'm not sure if I was supposed to remove "ready". I appended "go" after "ready". The timer in keypress doesn't work, but I think I'm close to getting it to work. My code for Change seems to only work in the console. Submit works, and Click works.
